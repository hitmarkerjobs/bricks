## What is Bricks?

Bricks is Hitmarker's design system. It's a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework built with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}. It provides consistent styling options to enable rapid development, as well as the flexibility to create new layouts and designs without the need to write additional CSS.

Feel free to check out the code and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/hitmarker/bricks){:target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}.
